# Multi-Project Repository: Python Chatbot, Tic-Tac-Toe, and TODO App

This repository contains three distinct projects showcasing beginner to intermediate-level programming skills in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Each project focuses on a specific functionality and can be used independently.

---

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Python Chatbot**
A Python-based chatbot designed to answer basic queries about data science topics. This bot is built to interact with users via the terminal and demonstrate natural language processing and simple AI techniques.

### 2. **Tic-Tac-Toe (Python)**
A command-line version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. This project demonstrates simple game logic, user interaction, and input validation.

### 3. **TODO App (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)**
A web-based TODO app that helps users manage their tasks efficiently. It features task creation, completion tracking, and deletion, all stored locally in the browser.

### 4. **Age and Gender Classification**

This repository provides an implementation of age and gender classification using OpenCV and Matplotlib. The model predicts the age group and gender of individuals from images or video streams.

## Features

- Detect faces in images or video using OpenCV.
- Classify age into predefined categories (e.g., 0-2, 4-6, 8-12, etc.).
- Classify gender as either Male or Female.
- Visualize the results with bounding boxes and labels using Matplotlib.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
